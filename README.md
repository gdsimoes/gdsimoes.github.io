# My Website

This is my personal website which I host using a Digital Ocean virtual machine. I used Nginx as my server and have enabled HTTP2.

I decided only to use plain HTML and CSS, avoiding libraries and frameworks such as Bootstrap and React, to learn the fundamentals of
responsive design and accessibility.
